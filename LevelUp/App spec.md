### User stories
As a goal-oriented user I want to manage (CRUD) goals and assign timed targets e.g. spend 20 hours in total learning Spanish or spend 3 hours every week exercising, so I can track progress on goals. (Must-have, phase 1)

As a goal-oriented user I want to group goals together under a mission to describe the underlying why behind the goals. (Must-have, phase 1)

As a goal-oriented user I want to see a snapshot of my progress; current and longest streak, similar to Github’s contributions, so I can stay more motivated consistently throughout the year. (Should-have, phase 2/3)

As a goal-oriented mobile user I want to quickly and easily update time spent against my goals so keeping data fresh isn’t neglected due to administrative burden. (Must-have, phase 1)

As a goal-oriented user I want my goals to be open and sharable but not editable by anyone else so I can hold myself publicly accountable to working toward my goals. (Could-have, phase 2/3)

As a developer who’s recently learned about MongoDB and the MEAN stack, I want to use this JavaScript stack to build a web application fit for desktop, tablet and mobile so I can gain experience building modern full stack JavaScript applications (Must-have, phase 1)

As a developer I want the user to have the option to login via traditional email/password (local auth) or via their Google account (OAuth) so I can gain experience providing mixed authentication options. (Must-have, phase 1)
