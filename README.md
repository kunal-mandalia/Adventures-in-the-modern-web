# Adventures-in-the-modern-web
Building full stack javascript apps to learn the ropes.

This is my foray into the world of modern web apps. There's two repos:
- Apps: concrete apps with real endusers addressing real world problems
- Core: projects focussed around building blocks and concepts of the web e.g. OAuth2, MV*, Callbacks, etc.
